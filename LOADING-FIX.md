# 🔧 Extension Loading Issue - RESOLVED!

## ❌ **Problem Encountered:**
```
Failed to load extension
Error: Could not load css 'content.css' for script.
Could not load manifest.
```

## ✅ **Root Cause:**
The manifest.json was looking for `content.css` in the root directory, but webpack was copying it to `styles/content.css`.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed Webpack Configuration**
Updated `webpack.config.js` to copy CSS to both locations:
```javascript
new CopyWebpackPlugin({
  patterns: [
    { from: 'public', to: '.' },
    { from: 'src/content/styles', to: 'styles' },
    { from: 'src/content/styles/content.css', to: 'content.css' } // Added this line
  ]
})
```

### 2. **Rebuilt Extension**
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. **Verified File Structure**
```
dist/
├── content.css          ✅ Now exists in root
├── content.js
├── background.js
├── popup.js
├── popup.html
├── popup.css
├── manifest.json
├── icons/
└── styles/
    └── content.css      ✅ Also exists here
```

## 🚀 **Now Ready for Loading:**

1. Open Chrome Canary
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `dist/` folder
6. Extension should load successfully! ✅

## ⚡ **Quick Test:**
- Press `Alt+N` on any webpage
- Floating toolbar should appear
- No console errors

## 🛠️ **Future Prevention:**
The webpack configuration now ensures CSS files are copied to the correct locations for both development and production builds.
